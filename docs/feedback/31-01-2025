Can do everything she wants to do it.
The colorscheme is good.
    Made the colorscheme corporate.
    In the very future it can be user defined

0 values should not be NaN, but should be 0 instead. so they should be white on the dashboard.
Preference to keep it like this, to have it be clear that it's 0, from the other.

A bug with 0 values not displaying on the page.

Use the sliders, instead of the input fields.
Display the values of the sliders after having saved, so the user knows the saved thresholds.

The implementation of the standard deviation might be wrong?
It uses the discrete random variable function, which seems to be wrong.
Test that it functions correct.

Add the raw counts, and filtered counts to the aggregated excel.

The rounding of the excel might not be mathematically accurate, but is left up as an exercise for the user.

Have it possible to see a line on the histogram to know the value you're selecting:
    Not possible now.
Select

From 0 to 100 for percentage

From 0 to max number for cell count, and standard deviation.

Choosing the range, choosing the colors
    Not possible now.

Search functionality for the experiments should be useful in the future.
